# Simulations for paper on screening rules for SLOPE

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

This repository contains code to reproduce the simulations used in the
paper on screening rules for SLOPE. It uses the R package **packrat** to
maintain a set of packages. If you are using R studio, you will only
need to open up the open `slope_screening_simulations.Rproj`. Otherwise,
please run `packrat/init.R` to make sure you have all of the correct
dependencies.

The `data` folder contains the set of data sets used in the paper. All
of code for the actual simulations is stored in the `R` folder.
